1: Craft the barrels
2: Put somewhere or into water
3: Punsh the barrels until they get cracked and see the terrible effetcs >:D

Tocix:
The water from the barrel will spread to all water and fills seas fast (be carefull with this).
It becomes gass over the water that you cant breath in.
You can be sick if you swim in the toxic water, swim in common water to be fresh.
The sicknes hurts depending on how sick you are, the sicknes infected other players too.
Swim in toxic water when it hurts making much more damage.
+ a poison gun - make your enemies & mobs sick >:)

Nitrogen:
The ice from the barrel will freeze water/toxic into it and the ice too, then it spreading on water surface in that way.
It becomes hurting gass over the ice, and it can freeze you, if you walk on the ice (can breaked with steel pick).
You can be sick if you walk on the ice.
+ a freezing gun - freeze your enemies & mobs (can be sick too) >:)

Sinkhole:
Making the underground hollow!
This is a slow process that the barrels replacing the underground with vacuum,
its recommended to use many of this barrels at same time.
When its done it making the ground crackly then it falls if a player walks on it.

Arsenic
Makes water around the world toxic, and hurts.
takes full effect after a restart
remove "pollution_arsenic" in the world folder do diable it

Kalium bottle:
Throw it on whatever block you want: it will come to life!
The very aggressive mobs attacks everything without their own team, even items.
Craft 3 Kalium bottles to make 1 Kalium pur / ender bottle (purple) 3x more health, teleports on attack & drops 2 common on death... 
Creepy! not even walls can hide you!

axov is a VERY dangerours mob that spawns on [toxic dirt] and [nitrogen ice], use this uncraftable tool to spawn them.
pollution:axovrifle
pollution:axovicerifle

Using toxic waste:
Put water (not flowing) over this blocks to make it spawn crystals over them, slowly.
coal-block
copper-block
steel-block
bronze-block
magnesium-block
obsidian-block
gold-block
mese-block
diamond-block

Crystal:
It replacing plants and trees in a big area around the barrel, and some dirt into it.
Break a crystal to use it as a sword with lightning power, it can hurt you until death in 1 hit!
(damage on each lightning shock) small=1, medium=2, big=5 
The crystal mobs spawn on the crystal soil, and spread the soil too, so be carefull with this!
+crystal river (works like a gravity gun) pick up players or stuff, right click to give a hard electric shock, it shocking until the object only have 10 health left, next use kills it.

Acid:
its as it sounds, be very careful with this, because it will burn (acid fire) next to everything that is near it, even players & ...
It does not starts common fire, but another that only burn objects, and it can unexpectedly spawn again on you (even you is far away from it).
The acid axov will spread fire everywhere at same time it burn everything it punching.
+ acid fire rifle (fire thrower) will throw some fire front of you, "place" it on blocks to fill the power, it wont get destroyed.

The portable chest:
it is as it sounds too, a locked chest, you can put in stuff, pick it up place somewhere else, and your stuff will be there!
the stuff saves inside a tool that you will get when punch it.

Ruclear reactor: pollution:nukers (spawning tool)
1: Put use a uranium barrel (orange) to put uranium fuel source in the hole, in middle of the reactor
2: break / place the generators (update the nodes)
3: Put a mineral item (stuff like coal, iron ... ) in generators (it restarts when you put in them)
4: Make sure no water comes near the fuel source, or no hot gas around it, or you will get problems.
You can also make a timed nuclearbomb


If you quickly need more water, punch a nitrogen barrel few times to freeze the water above.
If you need remove the meltdown, punch a acid barrel a few times. it can remove the radioactive source
