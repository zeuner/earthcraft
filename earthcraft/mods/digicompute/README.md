Digital Computers [digicompute]
=========================
* Version 0.5, beta
* Licence: MIT (see LICENSE)

This, is the first mod ever to attempt to provide fully functional computer and networking devices to the Minetest players. Originally inspired by [digiterm](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?pid=103857), the mod has begun to take an entirely new direction. Computers are completely stand alone. They require no other mods to function, and can run alone or as a group.

To get started, just place down a computer, right click on it to power it up, and right click again once it's on to set the computer name. From there on it's all up to you. If you aren't satisfied with the default operating system, see the API section below and learn how to make your own.

### Planned / WIP Features
* [wip] turtles
* gui operating system support
* package-like applications
* routers (internet)
* digiline support
* mesecon support

### API
digicompute is a mod that is meant to be customized, and tweaked by both modders and players. Along with the computers available out of the box, a powerful API is provided allowing modders to easily and quickly register their own computers, and soon peripherals, internal components, and other devices.

The OS API allows anybody to create their own operating system to run and distrubute right on their digicomputers. The possibilities are becoming endless, as operating systems will soon be able to further use the formspec to create a graphical experience right inside Minetest.

To learn more about the API, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/octacian/digicompute/wiki/). Or, see the files found in the `doc` directory.
